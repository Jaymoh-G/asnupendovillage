2. Add "Admin" role (keeps existing roles)
3. User now has Admin + previous permissions
4. User can manage users and delete content

### **🔹 Creating Custom Role:**

3. Assign to specific users
4. Users have limited, focused access

## **📞 Troubleshooting:**

### **🔹 Common Issues:**

-   **Auth errors**: Clear cache with `php artisan optimize:clear`

### **🔹 Commands for Debugging:**

```bash
# Check user roles
php artisan roles:manage users

# List all roles
php artisan roles:manage list

# Assign role to user
php artisan roles:manage assign --user=email@example.com --role=Editor

# Clear cache
php artisan optimize:clear
```
